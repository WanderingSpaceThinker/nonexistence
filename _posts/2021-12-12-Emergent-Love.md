Ah, love.

Such an elusive and mysterious topic that has existed since time immemorial. Everyone and their grandma has an opinion on it. But [what is love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEXWRTEbj1I) exactly? Well, sorry to disappoint, but we're not answering that today. Instead, let me cast a new light on how you visualize it.

![oprah]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.images[0].image_path }})
<p class="legend">Everybody got an opinion on love!!!</p>

First, we need to address an issue: The world "love" can encompass a wide assortment of concepts depending on person, country or language. Before writing, I asked some of my friends to tell me what love is. They all started very confused, and then went into totally different directions each time...

That's why in this article we'll only consider "love" as "the feeling of love" which is still pretty vague, but we'll make do.

You see, all my life I've thought of love as this strong feeling you could have towards a person/animal/object[^1]. Actually, this is also the Cambridge Dictionary definition:

> to like another adult very much and be romantically and sexually attracted to them, or to have strong feelings of liking a friend or person in your family

But you probably feel very differently about your significant other and your parents[^1]. In fact, I bet your feelings differ for each recipient of your love, with more or less variations depending on your relationship's nature.

Another way to signify this, is to have different "categories of love" with their own name: parental love, sibling love, romantic love... You could say it's like lightning, it's never exactly the same twice[^2].

If everyone has their own love, with a different "way of loving" for everyone and everything, we can picture this as a forest: The trees would be everyone's unique love, with each branch the way they love a particular whatever.

![forest]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.images[1].image_path }})
<p class="legend">"Forest of love" by WST - I know, I totally missed my vocation in art</p>

It's not like each tree and branch are entirely unique and distinct, though. There will be significant overlap between everyone's trees and branches. Sadly, this metaphor hardly represents how your feelings can evolve with time. It also stops short if we want to understand the similarities and differences across the forest.

For example, the branch of past and present romantic interests will have in common a love flavored with physical and sexual attraction. While on the friendship/platonic branch, we'll find close friends that are more like siblings.

What if suddenly you're attracted to one of them? The change doesn't warrant a complete redefinition of your love, it's more a continuation of the past that took a different turn. But now this branch has more in common with the romantic branches, to accurately compare we'd need many more "degrees of freedom" in our metaphor.

We have encountered a similar issue with [psychotypes]({{ site.baseurl }}/create/2021/09/28/The-color-of-your-mind.html) but that was because they stem from the complex mess of puzzle pieces that are our minds, while love is totally different... right?

Or maybe, love is not a monolithic feeling, maybe it's the result of the interactions of various underlying elements. Maybe love was an emergent property all along!

This would mean that each branch is unique as it results from the specific mix and proportions of feelings/factors that comprises it. Like a cooking recipe, each one has their own ingredients and quantities, except here, the list of available ingredients depends on the person the love blossoms from.

For example, a father's love for his offspring might be comprised, among other things, of a desire to protect and provide for them, to make them happy and ensure they grow into healthy adults. Of course, various underlying biological, sociological and [human compatibility]({{ site.baseurl }}/understand/2021/10/31/Human-compatibility.html) factors are also at play.

Wait, there's more! You can totally be attracted to someone without loving them, people don't think twice about their one-night stands... That's true of other feelings as well: a teacher wants their pupils to succeed, however, it can hardly be called love.

Perhaps, for a collection of feelings to qualify as love you need a baseline, a *love factor*, akin to an oven that bakes our ingredients into a cake, if we go back to our cooking recipe analogy. We can then redefine love as:

> The specific state of mind of a person, resulting from the interactions of their feelings towards a particular someone or something, and the love factor.

<p class="legend">A diagram showing an example of love, again expertly drawn</p>

Let's imagine for a second that everything here isn't speculation and this factor is real. First thing that comes to mind, what would it be? I feel like caring, in a broad sense, is the concept most inseparable from love[^3], so maybe this love factor is somehow linked to caring and attachment.

That said, we can't rule out that it's itself something more complex, less tangible, with roots in our biology. For instance, oxytocin may have an effect on the mother-child bond, it's possible it, or other compounds, have other love-related effects.

Next, we can try to imagine how it interacts with other feelings:
* Create: The feeling doesn't exist outside of love (e.g: desires to help at your own expense).
* Amplify: The feeling exists outside of love but in generally tamer versions (e.g: attraction, need for skinship).
* Transmute: The feeling exists outside but is radically transformed (e.g: jealousy, possessiveness).

There might be more, it's just to give an idea. In addition, it heavily depends on psychotype, remember, everyone has its own ability to love, so we can imagine the love factor's influences on our feelings is variable too.

As romantic love is the most influent of all, it'd be nice to know if it has any unique interactions with the love factor. Is it special because it has the strongest interactions between the love factor and our feelings? Or is it because it involves unique ingredients, like [limerence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerence)?

Another interesting area of study would be the relationship between this love factor and relatives of love, like admiration, obsession or passion. Are they the result of other factors that influence our feelings as well? Or are they influenced themselves by the love factor?

Sadly, for both topics I don't have the answers, only more questions... For now, at least.

Until now, I've focused more on the positive side of things, but life is not all roses and butterflies. Time to delve into the dark side of love: Toxic relationships, crimes of passion, domestic violence or even that omnipresent love triangle dynamic found in every romantic comedy ever...

You might argue that they aren't the result of love, how can you abuse or kill someone if you love them? In some cases, this is certainly true, but not loving means not caring and I'd bet those acts can result from caring *too much*, or in a twisted way at least[^4].

My conjecture being, those nefarious acts result from a buildup of negative emotions (resentment, jealousy, rancor...) originating from whether:
* the slow poison of incompatibility and time.
* actions from the other side that caused harm, disappointment, or broke trust.

Again, these emotions exist outside of love, and are generally minor. It means they also interact with the love factor... Which technically makes them an official part of love, as per our definition. Including them directly as a part of love isn't super convenient though.

I'd rather consider they generate a *mirror/negative* version of love that's akin to hate, a "love hatred" if you will, that can fluctuate in intensity with time and events. We do speak of the love-hate duality and of love-hate relationships after all.

The silver lining is, hatred is less prevalent than its love counterpart. That isn't too surprising, you rarely harm someone you love on purpose, and if you do, you'll at least try to patch things up. This lead to more positive interactions in relationships, overall.

When unadressed, this hatred will create a strain on the relationship, even before leading to drama. In most cases, I'd expect it to simply trigger a loss of love by somehow weakening the love factor. Not directly by itself, it might just make us reconsider the relationship and sever the ties as some kind of self-protecting mechanism.

In that scenario, the expected outcome is a progressive dying of both feelings leading towards either a mutation from romantic to (most likely) platonic love, or even plain indifference.

Alas, sometimes we just screw things up beyond a fixable state, we hit a major incompatibility wall, we aren't honest with ourselves or the other, and love grinds to a halt. This is part of life, we need to move on before the indifference numbs our skull, and the hatred corrupts our souls.

Alright, I've been torturing my mind for too long with this subject, it's time to wrap things up. Suffice to say, all these ideas are not based on facts and only reflect my own opinion on the matter.

I won't be surprised if you don't agree with me, it's perfectly fine. Still, I believe my "forest of love" metaphor and my love factor hypothesis might help you gain insight in the mess that's our loving hearts.

[^2]: No, wait, I'm mixing it up with snowflakes.
[^3]: To be clear, I mean that love implies caring, but you can totally care without loving.
[^4]: Be assured, I do not condone any of these actions. There is no context where harming others is justified.
