This is the first part of Society Issue, we will discuss an aspect of society that I believe deserves some improvements. Today we'll be talking about crimes, everyone's thirds best topic to ruin a family diner after religion and politics.

## <ins>Definition and Origins</ins>

> In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority. - Wikipedia

Great, what constitutes a crime is defined by the place you live in... Hopefully, there is a significant overlap that we can use as a least common denominator.

That can be a bit surprising but it means that the cost of those acts to current society is so great that they cannot be ignored almost everywhere.

We'll only consider two categories of civil crimes:
* Harmful to people and their possessions (assault, murder, theft...)
* Harmful to society (tax evasion, bribery, embezzlement...)

This kind of crimes reduces confidence in others/society and create inefficiencies (e.g: money spent on bribery isn't money spent on productive assets). These are not things I want in my society and this is why we're discussing this today.

So why do people commit these types of crimes? Just like wars, the answer is neither simple nor definitive. So much so that criminology is a field of science dedicated to the study of crime and their origin.

At its roots, crime is something we made up. People act because of their own reasons and we labeled some of those actions as crime.

A jealous husband kills his wife who cheated on him. A starving beggar steals food from a stall. An employee diverts funds from his company to pay debt. Intoxicated people at a bar start fighting.

More generally, a given person may (or may not) commit a crime, depending on their personality, their current physical and mental state and under a specific set of circumstances.

As you can guess, that's not helpful both to understand and reduce crime at a society scale. That's why one of the focus of criminology is to find factors that correlate with higher crime statistics.

## <ins>Factors of crime</ins>

Let's break down some of the findings:

<ins>Biology:</ins>
* Sex: males are overall more likely to commit crimes, especially violent ones.
* Age: most crimes are committed by people in their teens to their thirties.
* Substances: alcohol or drug use is correlated with crime both for consumption during the crime and addiction in general.
* Genetics: some genes linked to aggression or addiction are correlated with crime.
* Chemicals: lead poisoning during childhood increase criminal behavior.

<ins>Psychology:</ins>
* Mental disorders: a slew of mental disorders (schizophrenia, ADHD, depression...) are linked to higher crime rate.
* Personality traits: some anti-social personality traits (psychoticism, low empathy...) are linked to higher crime rate
* IQ: IQ is slightly negatively correlated with crime (high IQ means slightly less chance to commit crime), it might not be significant though.

<ins>Socioeconomic:</ins>
* Unemployment, income inequality and poverty tend to correlate with crime but it seems to have a lot of disparity between regions and periods, suggesting a complex relationship with crime.
* Drugs: The other side of drugs is, where they are illegal, they are provided by criminal rings. It's so lucrative it encourages gang wars, violence and corruption to stay in control.

<ins>Race and immigration:</ins>
* Obviously, this one is pretty controversial. Minorities and immigrants are generally over-represented in crime statistics but with a lot of disparity among groups and places, again indicating a real but complex relationship with crime.

The studies try to explain the relationship between those factors and crimes but they're only hypotheses so take everything that follows with a pinch of salt.

<p class="legend">That... should be enough.</p>

First thing first, those factors only correlates with crime and are not causes. Things like having *bad* genes or the lead poisoning do not guarantee you to commit crimes.

In fact, most people with multiple aggravating factors will **never** commit crimes. They're like little nudges that can make someone commit a crime where they might haven't otherwise.

Regarding the sex disparities, it's probably both because of actual physiology (testosterone linked to aggression...) as well as social-cultural factors (fights, weapons, considered more *manly* for example).

The age disparity isn't too surprising. Teenagers and young adults combine peak physical performance with poor impulse control, poor emotion regulation and a very stressful period of life. All of this make them more suitable to all kinds of reckless behaviors and can lead to substance abuse and/or delinquency.

For poverty, income inequality may strengthen the feelings of dispossession and unfairness in society leading to less remorse in committing crimes. That said, poor farming village in developing countries are not famous for their lawlessness. One key difference may lie in a stronger social structure and support in those villages.

Race and immigration is a bit of a tangled mess, there might be a vicious cycle of discrimination (higher policing, reduced life opportunities) that increases unfairness feelings and eases criminal behavior, further reinforcing discrimination.

It doesn't help that immigrants & minorities often are poorer and concentrated in more deprived communities with less opportunities for job or education.

The crime disparity among minorities may come from genetics as we saw earlier, but also from cultural differences. Some cultures with a strong sense of honor and tradition, of solving quarrels in private, are more likely to resort to violence for example.

One more thing I want to add. For some crimes, especially those that break into local or national news where some person stole a million over 10 years or something. They don't go from 0 to a million in one day, things start small and increase gradually as they feel they can get away with it. So detecting and preventing those behaviors early is important.

## <ins>Reducing crimes</ins>

Fundamentally, stopping crime means stopping people from doing criminal actions under the circumstances that lead them to and/or preventing those circumstances to happen altogether.

On an individual level that seems impossible, even with non-existent crime-predicting technology that probably wouldn't work (spoiler alert, that's the whole plot of Minority Report) as not all crimes are premeditated.

Maybe if we somehow tracked every single action of every single person but it would come at a high economic and freedom cost.

While we're at it, we should use an AI to oversee everything there's no way it can end badly, right?

<p class="legend">Do not resist</p>

So let's *see* what can be done on a broader scale:

<ins>Genes & IQ:</ins>

They're hard to control and their impact is low since most people with those factors do not commit crime. That means the solutions (eugenics, mass genetic surveillance) are disproportionate for the little effect they would have.

<ins> Personality Traits:</ins>

Pretty much the same as above but with personality instead of genes. Although, some *criminogenic* traits like obsessiveness or anger issues or antisocial behaviors, should be detected early to better accompany those people in the hope it reduces their chance of doing harm to themselves or others.

<ins>Chemicals:</ins>

Besides lead, there's other chemicals that affect our health/growth negatively. The key rule here is the [precautionary principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle), sadly detecting harmful effects before mass usage is challenging so constantly monitoring what's in use and updating health regulations with new data is the way to go.

<ins>Mental Disorders:</ins>

This is valid for this topic but, in general, there is huge room for improving mental health care and awareness.

Let's say we had a mental and physical check-up every year, it could improve the chances of detecting the aforementioned personality traits as well as the worst cases early and follow them with practitioners.

That could avoid things from degrading, if not improving and reduce this category of crime.

<ins>Drugs cartels:</ins>

Tough stances against drugs around the world hasn't solved illegal drug trade. The main reason is that it doesn't address the causes of addiction and addicts are willing to pay any prices to get their dose. This creates a profitable environment for sellers, no matter the risks.

One possibility to fix that, is to give in to market forces and legalize drugs. They would join the other mainstream legal drugs: tobacco, alcohol and coffee.

Now I understand the danger of those substances, so legalization should come with restrictions (high prices, minor ban, monthly quotas...) and maybe it will increase consumption but it will create jobs, increase tax revenue, reduce load on police and more importantly stop funding criminal networks.

<ins>Addiction:</ins>

The complementary to legalization is to address addiction (not only to substance) at its roots. Sadly, just like crimes, there is many risk factors of addiction and it could be its own sub-sub article so I'll try to be quick:
* Genetics contributes to addiction vulnerability, again we can't really do much for this.
* Age is also factor, teenagers are most vulnerable for the same reasons they're more prone to crimes. So education and promoting responsible use to the youth is important (but a bit vain, let's be serious).
* Stressful and traumatic events (war or crimes...) are big factors, fighting these will help but we're kind of in a loop here.
* Poverty can expose people to those events and reduce the access to health care or social support, acting as an indirect factor to addiction. Solving poverty seems quite a fetch (although...) so at the very least we should try to help addicts instead of punishing them.

<ins>Age/Sex/Socioeconomic/Race/Immigration:</ins>

All of the other factors are bundled because the solutions are certain to be complex, variable and they will take time and experimentation to figure out. What is sure is I don't have the answers.

But let's say the bulk of crimes from these factors come from feelings of rejection and unfairness, hopelessness for the future. Then by taking actions to create a fair and inclusive society, by improving social support for isolated citizens, we should see an impact on crime.

In addition, when kids fall into criminality, generally because of a *not stellar life*, they're more likely to stay in this path so education and caring for the youth and protecting them from bad influence are especially important.

Also, people have a (arguably) legitimate desire to improve their condition, if given the possibility there will always be someone tempted to do it at the expense of others. Stopping all abuse, would require, again, a disproportionate amount of surveillance that wouldn't work anyway.

I'd focus on the biggest ones, not hidden work nor welfare abuse but wealthy tax evasion and embezzlement by people in power. That should be done by enforcing transparency and accountability, there is a few countries with low corruption rate that we can inspire from like Norway with their public tax records.

Sadly, even if we miraculously did all of that, crime wouldn't disappear since we can't control everyone.

## <ins>Recidivism</ins>

Since we cannot stop crime, we need to tackle criminal recidivism - the act of a criminal to commit more crimes after being in prison - or more generally the way we try to *fix* criminals and the role of prisons.

The main objectives of prisons are:
1. Crime deterrence, the idea is prison is a "not nice" place and as such people will avoid crimes because they don't want to go there.
2. Rehabilitation, prison is so bad that living there serves as punishment for bad deeds and prisoners will avoid committing crimes in the future because they don't want to go back there.
3. Isolation, since the criminals are isolated from society, they cannot harm it anymore.

We had prisons for quite a long time and well, crimes and recidivism are still a thing so it means we can improve things, for the two first objectives at least.

The reasons prison don't quite work are:

* Psychology of punishment: Deterrence through punishment is not as simple as it sounds, it can actually be a double sided sword.
* Prison environment: In some countries, inmates culture is notoriously bad with a "survival of the fittest" kind of environment. That can encourage criminal behaviors or create trauma for victims of assaults in prison. Also, criminals all live together which can create networks of criminals and turn small thieves into full blown bank robbers after serving their sentence.
* Reinsertion: Society isn't too keen on ex-prisoners, which means they can struggle to find a job and build a "normal" life because of rejection. It doesn't help that criminals may had difficulties blending with society in the first place (made even worse by the disparity with prison culture).
* Root causes: Prisons do not try to address the reasons prisoner committed crimes.

What can we do to address those issues?

First, addressing the root causes is like the whole point of this article.

Also, fear of punishment works to a certain extent but *receiving* punishment, depending on a personality basis, can create strong resentment and badly implemented can further ostracize the punished.

Yet, if punishment is never delivered, there is no longer any fear, and it creates impunity. As with everything here, it's a careful balancing act to solve.

It is legitimate to want criminals to be punished for their deeds and for the harm they caused but punishment does not fix the issues and blindly punishing just contributes to a cycle of violence that judicial systems were supposed to break.

Then, no matter what we do, anti-social and dangerous people will always exist and we need to deal with it. Locking them up in prison is a safe and easy solution, ideally allowing them to work and contribute to society somehow. That's mainly why we had prisons for so long and why we'll still have them.

Reinsertion could be improved by trying to reintegrate criminals in society, at least the less dangerous, more receptive or youngest of them. That could be done by turning prison sentences for smaller crimes to a punishment that allows to rebound like house arrest with forced classes or something.

We could also have specialized facilities, like lighter prisons focusing on "social reeducation", the idea being to avoid creating criminal networks by mixing small thieves with cartel drug dealers and with hopefully with a healthier environment than your average prison prison.

Finally, giving second chances to ex-prisoners because shunning them won't help them reintegrating society. Without being naive, violent people or sex criminals should be monitored and kept away from whatever they could be tempted to do again.

## <ins>Conclusion</ins>

As you probably noticed by now, crime is a tangled mess of interdependent issues.

![tangled]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.images[2].image_path }})
<p class="legend">Artistic representation</p>

Trying to "solve" or rather reduce crime requires a holistic approach that modify various aspects of our society.

This will be a recurring pattern in future articles to the point where put together, they will describe an alternative society as a byproduct, something like my idealized society.

Returning to crimes, we talked about many potential improvements, yet we only scratched the surface. Admittedly, things like "improving education" are vague, but that's because actual solutions needs to be crafted on the terrain through experimentation.

But in a generic manner, reducing crime is about
1. Improving other issues like mental health, poisonous substance or addiction.
2. Shifting the balance of incentives towards not committing crimes, by making it easier to live *regularly*, through stable society, good education and social support. Also, by deterring crimes through a carefully balanced repressive system that triggers fear of punishment without alienating people on the receiving end.
3. Reducing the possibility of individuals to abuse society, by making rules clear, with vigilance, transparency and accountability but without trading-off too much freedom and handing them to an authority that could, ironically, abuse them.
4. Focusing efforts on criminal reinsertion, by being forgiving but not naive, by dedicating part of the retribution to those efforts.

As a final note, there's something I want to address. I focused on solving the issue as much in a vacuum as I could, ignoring stuff like cost, logistics, legislation, that makes changing things excruciatingly slow and complicated.

So, for convenience's sake, I explored what we could do without those constraints and that's what we'll also do for future entries.
