This website is a place to store things I want to write about or ideas I had observing the world around me and eventually share it to the two people that might wander here by accident.

Any resemblance to the work of someone else will be accidental because I try to come up with my ideas independently. But I can't avoid being influenced unconsciously and there is no guarantee I'm the first to write about these.

Although I'll try my best to avoid blatant misinformation, I'm no expert or scholar and you shouldn't take any facts or claims I make here for granted. If you see any mistake, feel free to notify me through the [contact form]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/index.html).

Finally, everything you will read here is my humble opinion. I understand and repect that we can have radically different ones and I have no intention to offend anyone. Should it upset you for any reason whatsoever then I'm sorry, please don't send mean things.

Hope you will enjoy reading.
