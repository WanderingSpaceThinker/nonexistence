Today's subject is one of the first ideas worth writing about I had, a whopping 12 years ago. It all started a freezing winter morning. As I'm waiting the bus to go to school, I wonder: *Is there anything perfect in this word?*

You might wonder what was the point of this and there is none really. I know I like to rationalize and find purpose to stuff but I still do things for **fun**... sometimes.

Before I continue this story let's make a small detour back to our favorite, Cambridge's Dictionary, so we can get the definition of perfection:

> "the quality of being perfect"

Err... not entirely helpful. Fine, let's check the definition for perfect then:

> "complete and correct in every way, of the best possible type or **without fault**"

This sounds close enough to my internalized definition. The bold part in particular is what I was using to answer my question back then. Reaching perfection in this sense is notoriously difficult and often synonymous with unattainable, hence my vain struggle at finding an answer.

Here is the mental image I have for this definition:

![black_white]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.images[0].image_path }})
<p class="legend">This is not a flag. Probably.</p>

The idea is: Perfection is the white (or black if you prefer) and everything else is the other color. This makes for a stark difference between the two and it's very simple... too simple for my taste.

It could also have been a grayscale from perfect to its opposite, such that it's very smooth from one side to the other:

![grayscale]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.images[1].image_path }})
<p class="legend">Where does it start, where does it end?</p>

But I don't like it because now it makes it hard to realize where things start or end and also, it's kind of boring and dull.

Let's go back to the original topic at hand. *"Maybe I should reverse the question. Since nothing is absolutely flawless, isn't there anything I can deem perfect and find a new idea of perfection? Like, what's the point of having an ideal that you can't reach anyway?"* I thought to myself.

Now I need to find a model for my not-simple, not-boring, kind-of-pointless new definition. Preferentially, something that's not a creation of our tainted brains, something from this world that has some remarkable properties, worthy of idealization.

My choice for this, is life. I don't mean any particular species or organism but the entirety of it, what could also be referred as "nature". After all, it's a gigantic pile of [emergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) properties that are worth investigating in this pointless pursuit.

I hinted at this in the previous article but life (as we know it) really fascinates me. When you think about it, we are all composed of an incomprehensible number of different tiny living factories themselves a huge and complex arrangement of (mostly) not-living components and proteins. All of this work in unison to make it work and let me write stuff nobody cares about on the web, neat!

As someone who always liked to understand systems or machines' inner workings, you can see how it leaves me in awe. Without real hope to ever grasp how any given organism really functions due to the sheer complexity. Of course, there's also a lot we still don't — and might never — know...

There's also the fact that life persisted through truly cataclysmic events. That it appeared out of nothing, although we still know very little about how this happened. That we have to take an astonishing amount of effort to make sure only a *little* of it hitchhikes on our space robots. I could go on for hours but we're not here for that.

<p class="legend">Just look at this crazy stuff</p>

All of this to say, I don't see anything better suited for the job than something that:
* defies expectation by, you know, not being dead like most of the universe.
* has a mind-boggling ballet of molecular cycles, a precise danse of protein processes.
* can withstand the end of the world and thrive even where you don't expect it.

Back on track, the key properties I'd like to extract from my model are: adaptability, diversification and sustainability. You know where this is going so let's speedrun this:

* **<ins>Adaptability:</ins>**

> an ability or willingness to change in order to suit different conditions

It's the engine of the evolution process... or is that the other way around? Anyway, the forces of the universe are tough, to exist you need to carefully squeeze yourself where you can and go with the flow. Indeed, most of the time, organisms conform to their environment and try to adapt whenever it changes.

Why not the other way around? Instinctively I'd say it's because conforming the environment to your needs is more difficult by several orders of magnitude, meaning that adapting is the simpler, more efficient and maybe more elegant solution.

Species that mold their environment do exist though, they're called [ecosystem engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_engineer). Beavers are a well-known example which have a surprisingly big environmental impact. Also, you won't be surprised to learn that humans are the most prolific of the bunch, for better or for worse.

The lesson I get from this: perfection is not going to be something fixed, but dynamic, ever-evolving, following the changes of its environment, whatever that means.

* **<ins>Diversification:</ins>**

> the process of starting to include more different types or things

Mass extinction events, that leads to the disappearance of a big chunk of species living at the time, are bad<sup>[citation needed]</sup>. They were a few during our planet's history, the most famous being the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event (you might remember it as the "meteorite killing dinosaurs one" even though there's no consensus on its exact causes).

As tragic as they are for the extinguished species, they can be a boon for the survivors as they can "rebuild" on the ruins left by the old world. For example, after the non-avian dinosaurs disappeared around 66 millions years ago, there was an explosion in [mammal diversity](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2015/dec/mammal-diversity-exploded-immediately-after-dinosaur-extinction).

The gist of it is, each species plays a role in an ecosystem, they fill an [ecological niche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche). When they're gone, that niche is empty and can be filled by another species or scrapped together and replaced by something else, leading to increased diversification.

The reason why this happen is, if a niche was eating one kind of food (grass for example) and it's now empty, it means that whoever can fill it will get access to a food source without competition. That way, available resources (type of food) can be more efficiently allocated than if all the species wanted to eat the same thing. Another advantage is, if one type of food disappear, it will only affect the species that relied on it.

This is probably over-simplified but, alas, I'm not a biologist so I can't go into more details than that. Besides, I don't want you to think that this article is a cover for a biology class.

The takeaway here is: a crisis is an opportunity to exploit the demise of others for your own gain... Wait what? No, please don't.

More seriously, diversification is an important tool for the efficient use of resources and it improves resiliency. Also, variety is fun: our past is filled of crazy alien-like creatures, that has to be more interesting that if there were only one species.

* **<ins>Sustainability:</ins>**

> the quality of being able to continue over a period of time

Life on Earth started around 3.7 billion years ago and even though there were minor hiccups like [the entire planet entirely freezing a few times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_Earth) along the road, it's still going strong. For context, modern humans have been around for 100 000 years, civilization started 10 000 years ago and the Industrial Revolution 200 years ago.

Yet, at least as of writing this article, in a short amount of time, we're simultaneously at risk of running out of natural resources (eg: fossil fuel) and accumulating too much byproducts (eg: plastics and greenhouse gases), threatening our current livelihood and future development, so how give?

Well, remember those snowball earths? That might have been organisms sifting most of the greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and, [at one occasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxidation_Event), killing their contemporaries by producing oxygen... how the tables have turned.

Even more striking, plastic trash accumulating in nature is a big problem right now because the few organisms able to degrade it are rudimentory. Nature may have encountered a similar problem back in the [Carboniferous period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous#Rocks_and_coal).

Back then, bark-bearing, tree-like plants newly appeared but the organisms capable of breaking down this bark probably weren't as efficient as they are now, resulting in an accumulation of those plants when they died.

In addition, because the irony just can't stop, this plant material eventually turned into big coal deposits, the same coal that *fueled* the Industrial Revolution...

In the end, evolution pressure incentivized the creation of organisms able to decompose bark and use it as a food source, closing a loophole in the [carbon cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle) (I swear I didn't plan to drop that much biology lingo).

Something similar is starting to appear with plastics but don't get your hopes up. It'll probably take a few million years without our intervention.

The conclusion is pretty clear. A system can only work long-term with some sort of cycle or equilibrium to ensure its sustainability. It doesn't need to be perfectly balanced or neat neither, as long as you have forces that will **adapt** said equilibrium as needed.

Ok, we have everything we need, time to update my mental image for the new perfection:

![superliminal]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.images[3].image_path }})
<p class="legend">Epileptic beware?</p>

You might have a hard time processing everything so if you want to understand, it comes from the final part of the puzzle game Superliminal. Yup, that's free advertisement.

Back in the day, I named the concept *"flawed equilibrium between balanced and unbalanced"* which could be the name of the gif if it was in an art gallery.

With that, let's craft the new definition of perfect:

> The quality to adapt as needed, to diversify and be varied, to maintain some sort of equilibrium in order to be sustainable in the long-term

It sums up everything pretty nicely, albeit it lacks a notion of fuzziness and chaotic energy that nature has, being a stochastic process. Coincidentally, this new ideal would be a great fit for the society I described previously.

Reading that you might think "Wait a minute WST, did you wrote all of this to talk about biology and say the same thing as your precedent article but in a different manner?". Well, to be honest, I can't deny either of those things but I can assure none of this was planned ahead.

Anyway, class is over... wait, wait! Don't leave too quickly, I have some **fun** homework for you: I'd like to know what would you chose if you were to create a new ideal, and why. You have until next class.
