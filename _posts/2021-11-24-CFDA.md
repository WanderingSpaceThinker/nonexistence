There is something I particularly dislike in politics: tribalism[^1]. It's best exemplified whenever a party writes a bill, the opposition denounces it as "the worst thing ever". Then, some time later, another party bring it back, but now the first party suddenly dictates it's "the worst thing ever".

It makes them look like they're more interested in scoring points against the other "teams", than constructively working on improving the lives of their constituents. I assume they do that because it somehow helps them in holding into power, and since it's the end goal of politics, that's a pretty strong incentive.

Another reason, is the ideological differences between those political groups can fuel blind rivalry, turning political life in some kind of toxic team sports, if left unchecked. This phenomenon of fighting over our differences permeates throughout society, to the most minute of them.

As an historical example[^2], during the reign of Justinian I and Theodora in the VIᵗʰ century, the Byzantine Empire's church was split between Orthodox and Monophysite Christians. The fundamental difference was about accepting (or not) the dual nature of the Christ (both human and divine)...

It sounds ridiculous to us now and yet, that divide was as bitter as the Protestants vs Catholics schism. You know, the one that ended in a few [massacres here and there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre).

For examples that you might be familiar with, think about those endless debates about car brands, sports teams, smartphone OS superiority... It just shows that the reason we argue is more a pretense to sort ourselves into separate groups of belonging. The process is somewhat unconscious, susceptibility to it vary with psychotype, and the animosity between groups is generally pretty weak[^3].

This behavior might find its roots in our ancestor's tribe lifestyle, as getting too big and diversified of a group might have been too much to handle back then, so it would make sense to organically split the group into like-minded individual, but that's pure speculation.

Regardless of its origins, it became problematic now since we generally benefit from being the biggest group possible, in terms of economies of scale and specialization. Without that, no individual would have the ability to create a space program on its own[^4].

To combat this, I propose an ideology where we recognize and focus on what we have in common, and put aside our differences. It's fine to acknowledge them, we need to avoid tearing us apart over them. Let's name it "Common First, Division Aside[^5]" or C.F.D.A. for short.

By the way, this ideology already came up in the 17th century under the name [Irenicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenicism), in order to mend rifts in the Catholic Church[^6]. It probably came up many times before that: we saw the Byzantine Empire had the same issue, and it's still very common nowadays.

In order to implement this "CFDA", we first need to realize when we're fighting over our pointless divisions. Note that we shouldn't naively ignore those divisions, simply try not to be too confrontational about them.

One way to do that is by putting what we agree on front and center, and calmly work our way to where, and why, our opinions diverge. It's likely impossible to agree on everything anyway, and it's fine, we simply need to coexist peacefully and constructively.

That common-centric approach won't work for differences in tastes or hobbies though, if you find the very idea of hunting repulsive, if you see life in a fundamentally different manner[^7], there isn't much common ground you can find.

The general attitude to adopt, is of tolerance, open mindedness and giving the benefit of the doubt, whenever possible. Again, not in an overly naive manner as there will be mischievous spirits that take pleasure, or have vested interests, in stoking the flames of dissent.

You may find that evil, but even if you do, they're probably [necessary]({{site.baseurl}}/society/2021/07/26/The-cruel-necessity-of-evil.html), meaning we need to learn how to live with them. We can do so by limiting your violent reactions to the baits, taunts or trolls you're sure to encounter, especially online.

Ignoring them can be really tough sometimes, but you're unlikely to change someone's mind by arguing with them, especially if they're acting in bad faith, so why bother?

Look, I believe there isn't a single issue where we can get everyone to agree on. If we want to throttle the petty infighting that plagued society for so long, it'll take continuous efforts from everybody.

All of this might be depressing and bring up the misanthrope in you, so let me uplift your spirit with a neat closing quote:

> We do have a lot in common. The same Earth, the same air, the same sky. Maybe if we started looking at what's the same instead of what's different... well, who knows[^8].

[^1]: Obviously there's tons more to dislike, and this particular problem only applies in democracies.
[^2]: As usual, not an expert, so I might end up overly simplifying or getting stuff wrong.
[^3]: After all, death threats or [references to extreme ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law) are unheard of in online debates, right?
[^4]: Look, I know who you're thinking about, but would they be so rich without a global economy? Would their companies survive without NASA as their biggest client?
[^5]: Yes, I know, I suck at naming stuff.
[^6]: Geez, who knew religion could be such a contentious subject?
[^7]: On this subject, do you remember when the internet was fighting over the [color of a dress](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/science-one-agrees-color-dress/)? That was... fun.
[^8]: If you wonder where this is coming from, that's a quote from Meowth at the end of the first Pokemon movie (1998)...
