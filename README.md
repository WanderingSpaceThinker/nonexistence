## Blog

This is a blog I made so I can express my thoughts and to make sure they will still exist somewhere, sometime.

It's a jekyll theme based on the excellent hcz theme found [here](https://github.com/codeasashu/hcz-jekyll-blog) and you can reuse the site's code however you like.

The posts themselves are subjet to author's right and you cannot copy, modify or republish them without my consent.

The images used on the site aren't owned by me, I found them on google images, giphy or stock images and eventually added some text on them.
