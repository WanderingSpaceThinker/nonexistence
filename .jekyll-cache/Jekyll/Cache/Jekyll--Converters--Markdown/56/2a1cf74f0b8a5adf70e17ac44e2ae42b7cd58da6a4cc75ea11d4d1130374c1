I"<p>This website is a place to store things I want to write about or ideas I had observing the world around me and eventually share it to the two people that might wander here by accident.</p>

<p>Any resemblance to the work of someone else will be accidental because I try to come up with my ideas independently. But I can’t avoid being influenced unconsciously and there is no guarantee I’m the first to write about these.</p>

<p>Although I’ll try my best to avoid blatant misinformation, I’m no expert or scholar and you shouldn’t take any facts or claims I make here for granted. If you see any mistake, feel free to notice me through the <a href="/contact/index.html">contact form</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, everything you will read here is my humble opinion. I understand and repect that we can have radically different ones and I have no intention to offend anyone. Should it upset you for any reason whatsoever then I’m sorry, please don’t send mean things.</p>

<p>Hope the two of you will enjoy reading.</p>
