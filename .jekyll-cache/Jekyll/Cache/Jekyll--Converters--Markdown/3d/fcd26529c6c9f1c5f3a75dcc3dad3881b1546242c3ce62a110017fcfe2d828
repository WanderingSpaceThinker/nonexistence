I"1<p><em>Before we begin, please check the <a href="/others/2021/01/21/Disclaimer.html">disclaimer</a>… Done already ? Alright, let’s dive in.</em></p>

<p>For the universe, there is no good, no bad, no justice, no sadness, no joy in the dark void, no grief in the cold rocks and no pain in the (more or less) glowing (more or less) gas (more or less) spheres out there. The universe doesn’t hold any values or feeling.</p>

<p>Because, to our current knowledge, these things only exist in the mind of the social, conscious, living part of the universe we know of: you… and everyone else and some of the other living things on our damp space rock, so don’t let it go to you head.</p>

<p>Speaking of our existence (and all current life on Earth for that matter), it’s truly astonishing what the stochastic process of evolution was able to produce during those billions of years. The downside is that it means we were all created without any particular intent but keeping the cycle of life and evolution going.</p>

<p>Coming back to the universe, if a medium size meteorite were to crash on Earth, if a pulsar decided to beam on the solar system, if any other catastrophic event were to wipe us all out, nobody, or rather, nothing will weep for us. We don’t matter any more than everything else, that is not at all.</p>

<p>Nope you’re not watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14">kurzgesagt</a>, I just decided to kick-start this blog with  everyone’s favorite, some good old existential dread!</p>

<p>What I’m getting at is: if there is no purpose to your life then you get to choose whatever purpose suits you and if there is no fundamental values to the universe then we get to decide which ones we want for ourselves.</p>

<p>It’s time to forget everything you were taught and starts anew. Look into your mind, what are the values you want society to uphold and why? Obviously, I’m writing because I thought about this and I’ll share my conclusions but I’m curious to know what you non-reader think.</p>

<p>Alright, I’ll tell you the values I’d choose should I be master of the universe (one day… one day). They also serve as a core philosophy of mine, an invisible thread that weaves my mind and so, this harbor of my thoughts.</p>

<p>The first one is <strong>Pragmatism</strong>. Here is the definition in the Cambridge Dictionary as we need one and it’s the first I got on <search engine="" name="">:</search></p>

<blockquote><h4>"the quality of dealing with a problem in a sensible way that suits the conditions that really exist, rather than following fixed theories, ideas, or rules"</h4></blockquote>

<p>This is an important part of the scientific method: it values a theory based on how well it fits experimental data and will try to change the theory if it doesn’t fit.</p>

<p>The other end of the spectrum is manipulating facts, up to creating them <em>ex nihilo</em>, to justify the theory, this is something recurrent in cults and conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>As stated at the beginning, one isn’t inherently better than the other because <em>nothing</em> is. I favor the first one because, as you update your theory with relevant data, you have a good chance to produce results, weeding out spurious ideas and bypassing cognitive biases brought upon us by evolution.</p>

<p>On the other side, you can also produce results but you need to be lucky. It’s a bit like trying to shoot a target in a thick fog, the chances are very small but not nil. More importantly, this kind of mental rigidity can be problematic should the need to adapt to rapid change in environments arise.</p>

<p>What about theories, ideas or rules for which we cannot get data to prove or disprove, either because we don’t know how or we don’t have the capabilities (now or ever)? This is a big blind spot for this definition of pragmatism, so let me amend my first “universe value” that we will now call <strong>Extreme Pragmatism</strong> (explosions in the background).</p>

<blockquote><h4>"the quality of dealing with a problem in a sensible way that suits the conditions that really exist, rather than following fixed theories, ideas, or rules <b>and ignore all problems for which it cannot be applied</b>"</h4></blockquote>

<p>To clarify, it doesn’t mean this kind of problem is to be discarded entirely, I understand why they can be interesting and important. Just that by essence, we can’t get to the bottom of it and it feels like a <em>waste of time</em> (foreshadowing).</p>

<p>So how would this value benefit society? Well, basing or updating a policy on actual results rather than belief has a better chance in solving a problem since the belief one would need to be, out of all possibilities, a valid one.</p>

<p>That’s not as easy as said though, it requires the way data is gathered and analyzed to be and stay relevant, meaning it should itself be subject to pragmatism making a beautiful, delicious, multi-layered pragmatism cake.</p>

<p>To illustrate this I don’t have a real life example because, to be honest, I haven’t really looked and there’s always an amount of politic, legacy or social consideration in policies anyway.</p>

<p>I do have a counter-example though: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/turkish-lira-crisis-erdogan-interest-rates-2018-8">A Turkish head of state firm belief on interest rates</a>. As you can read, his belief contradicted what economic history taught us about interest rates: when inflations goes up, they need to go up. His refusal to increase them seems to have worsened Turkey’s inflation back then (It’s still going as of writing but it might be history when you get to read this).</p>

<p>The point is: it is bad on an individual level if a belief prevents them from making the good choice but when it’s a person in charge of a company, a country it can be downright catastrophic and tragic since people dealing with the consequences often didn’t take the decision themselves. This risk alone is, in my opinion, enough reason to push for pragmatism at every level of society.</p>

<p>That’s it for the first value so let’s continue. We live in a world where resources are limited, whether it’s our time alive, natural resources or energy, everything have a finite limit. Even our sun and all the other stars will eventually shine one last time before eternal darkness. That is if they’re not already dead and we don’t know yet thanks to special relativity.</p>

<p>Sorry I’m back again with more existential dread, the year has been tough… Since everything is limited, we should make sure we make good use of those resources, that we use them <em>efficiently</em> and that we need to avoid waste whenever possible.</p>

<p>The main reason I add this is I’m biased for efficiency, I don’t tolerate any kind of waste (time, food, energy…) but we can’t stop here, there needs to be rationalization and reasoning when choosing values for anything but yourself, so here it is:</p>

<p>This moderation should buy us more time in the “great escape onward” that is solving our critical problems with an ever-increasing web of technology, knowledge, logistical chain that just adds even harder issues to solve on top (Goodbye long travel times across the globe and hello g̷̟̦̅l̷͙̗̼̬̏̒͗͊̚͜ò̵͉͇͒͑̄͝b̴͎̝́a̵̧̢̹̻̋̈̌̾̈́l̶̩̘̤̔̎ ̵̣̗͕̈́̓̚͝w̴̡̛͇̥͍ā̵̙͓̤r̴̺̭̪̓͗m̸̠̲̹̺̈́i̵̪̋n̷̢̥̭̹͒g̸̛͉͍̲̟̅͐͝ ). That’s why I want to add <strong>Efficiency</strong> as the second key value.</p>

<p>As a side note on this phenomenon, I know that it can seem pretty unsustainable to keep piling up complex problems and expanding forward. Is it reasonable to siphon metals from neighboring celestial bodies because they’re too rare on our planet to manufacture 1 billion smartphones every year? Is it justifiable to turn the entirety of Mercury into a satellite swarm obscuring the sun to solve our energy problem? Do we really have to go as far as we can just for the sake of it?</p>

<p>This is a tough question that needs to be answered in depth and collectively. Personally, I lean more into the yes with conditions but I understand people that feel like we went too far when we started modifying our planet’s ecosystem, endangering most of the living species, us in particular, in the process.</p>

<p>For those who yearn for a simpler life, there might be a way to coexist with the growing convoluted mess we actually have but we’ll have to discuss it <a href="/thoughts/Meta-society.html">another time</a>.</p>

<p>Back on track, we have our major values but before adding more, I’d like to illustrate how I’d apply them on a real societal issue: death penalty.</p>

<p>Since we have two values, we have two question to asks:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Q1: Does it work in solving the problem it's supposed to solve?</u></li>
The main argument in favor of death penalty is it reduces criminality as people will fear for their life but a quick look on the topic seems to indicate that no, it doesn't reduce crime rates and with a solution that drastic, anything less that a complete disappearance of crimes altogether probably isn't worth it.
<li><u>Q2: Is it an efficient use of our resources?</u></li>
So I guess that killing a criminal will free up some space in prison (yeah I realize how awful this sentence is, sorry) but this is meaningless. How many years, food, energy it takes in order to make a grown human adult? How much value this person would have produced in his time if they was still alive? The amount of wasted resources probably dwarves any gain obtained by the execution.
</ul>

<p>So just by those answers it seems death penalty is a no-no. Now to be clear, I am against death penalty for these very reasons but also because I believe killing isn’t a decent way to deal with any problems whatsoever and most notably, the risk of killing someone innocent is unacceptable.</p>

<p>There is many values I wanted to add but I realized you could derive them from the other two. For example, using our resources efficiently, includes making sure we all are efficient ourselves. Looking at developed West, one way to do this is to ensure a high standard of living, education and personal freedom and if we look at trends in some companies, it seems ensuring the well-being and happiness of their employees improves their productivity.</p>

<p>I don’t want to picture an overly rosy picture of reality. This can only happen when the incentives align just right for the people in charge. Sadly, there is many cases where they don’t. As such, things like freedom, education or <em>not-brainwashing-their-population-against-a-more-or-less-fictive-common-ennemy</em> are “luxuries” they can’t afford, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs">other people went into more details about this</a>.</p>

<p>Still, it means that values like peace, tolerance, freedom, people’s well-being should apply when they can.</p>

<p>Finally, there is one last value I need to add, that is related to the next article: <strong>Diversity</strong>. Let’s pull another definition from Cambridge’s dictionary:</p>

<blockquote><h4>"the fact of many different types of things or people being included in something; a range of different things or people; the fact that there are many different ideas or opinions about something:"</h4></blockquote>

<p>The idea here is to encourage the widest range of ideas, culture, recipes… to coexist inside society, as long as they don’t conflict with the other key values. The reason being, outside of having more choice for delicious, delicious food, this variety should provide a higher chance to produce a solution to a given problem hence making society more resilient (and fun) overall.</p>

<p>Just like having a lot of different crops ensures one disease alone can’t threaten food security. There’s also that investor’s saying about not having all the same baskets on the omelet… or something like that.</p>

<p>That’s it for the values I’d like to see for the universe or society. I hope you enjoyed reading the first of what I could have called <strong>A random’s dude boring take on an uninteresting subject</strong>, it might end up being this blog’s name, who knows? I (re)invite you to think about all of this yourself, I need a variety of opinions on this topic if I want to follow my own principles after all.</p>
